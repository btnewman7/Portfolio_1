        <p>I'm a <b>Data Analyst</b> and <b>Data Engineer</b>, but stopping there would be poor story-telling, and that's half the fun of data, isn't it? You already know what I do, so let me tell you a bit about who I am.</p>
        <p>I grew up near Boston, went to school in Seattle (Go Dawgs), and now reside in the heart of New York City. I'm a nerd, facinated by the human body, and aware of the nutritional value of everything I put into it. I also love statistics, which is probably why baseball-reference.com is the homepage on my web browser.</p>
        <p>Ultimatley my passion is to explore and experience. Whether its a new skill I want to learn (coding, cooking, painting), or a city and people I have yet to visit. This passion brought me to the field of data- a field whose purpose is to be explored and to expose us to the little details and patterns of life we couldn't otherwise see.</p>
